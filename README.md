# Customer Churn Prediction 🚀

## 🖖 Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning. Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers stop using a product or service. By analyzing customer behavior and demographic data, we aim to build a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn and help businesses take proactive retention strategies.

## 💡 Key Features
- End-to-end machine learning pipeline implementation.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover customer churn patterns.
- Machine learning model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- Deployment as a REST API using FastAPI/Flask.
- Organized project structure for easy understanding and extensibility.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv churn_env
   source churn_env/bin/activate   # For Mac/Linux
   churn_env\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
   - Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder.
   - Open `eda.ipynb` to explore the dataset and perform data analysis.
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Train the Model**
   - Use `scripts/train_model.py` to train and evaluate the model.
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

2. **Deploy the Model**
   - Use `api/app.py` to start the FastAPI/Flask server.
   ```bash
   uvicorn api.app:app --reload
   ```

3. **Access the API**
   - Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser or use Postman for testing.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures the ability to capture all positive cases.
- **ROC-AUC**: Evaluates the model’s ability to differentiate between classes.
